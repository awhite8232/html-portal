<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! My name is Andy White and I'm a new web developer. The process of learning to code has been enjoyable and rewarding! At 
  this time, I have only learned the basics of HTML; however, I can tell that this is something that I want to explore further and am
looking forward to continuing the learning process.</p>

<p>One of the most appealing aspects of learning to code is the creative process that is involved. I also enjoy problem solving 
  when my code is not working as expected. I am really developing a passion for web development and am excited for the future!
</p>

<p>I really hope you've enjoyed my website and getting a taste of what I am able to do in my journey thus far. Please check in on a regular basis as I 
  continue to learn and grow. Also, any and all feedback is welcome. I really want to hear from the community and get to know other developers who 
  share the same passion for coding. Thank you!</p>
